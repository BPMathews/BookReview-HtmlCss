<p>Swift is a multi-paradigm, compiled programming language created by Apple for iOS and OS X development. Introduced at Apple's 2014 Worldwide Developers
Conference (WWDC), Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products. Swift is intended to be more resilient to erroneous code ("safer") than Objective-C, and also more concise. It is built with the LLVM compiler framework included in Xcode 6, and uses the Objective-C runtime, allowing C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within a single program.</p>
