    <p class="review">My family tries to aggressively pay down debt. We find it very motivating to see the impact that making an extra payment or paying extra can have on any loan we might have. Loans makes it easy to do this. It has a nice design and great features. Well worth the $2 upgrade to pro! By motivating you to pay down debt, it easily pays for itself.</p>
