I am currently working my way through Jon Duckett's book [HTML & CSS Design](http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189). 

My goal is to work my way through every chapter and recreate all of his examples in order to gain a better understanding of the source material. I have "learned" HTML and CSS in the past but it never really stuck due to lack of practice. I also plan on creating an additional exercise page that would be a summary of everything learned up until the end of the current chapter.

You can find examples written by the author and other tools on the [Official Website](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code/).
