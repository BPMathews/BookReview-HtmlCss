  <h1>Objective-C</h1>
  <p>Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. It is the main programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS operating systems, and their respective application programming interfaces (APIs), Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.</p>

  <h1>Swift</h1>
  <p>Swift is a multi-paradigm compiled programming language created by Apple for iOS and OS X development. Introduced at Apple's 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference, Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products. Swift is intended to be more resilient to erroneous code ("safer") than Objective-C, and also more concise (the same idea can be expressed with a smaller quantity of code). It is built with the LLVM compiler framework included in XCode 6, and uses the Objective-C runtime, allowing C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within a single program.</p>
